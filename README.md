## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first approach
- Vite as bundler
- Responsive design

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced several important concepts:

1. **Tailwind CSS**:

   - Implementation of a custom design system with color variables
   - Usage of responsive classes for different breakpoints
   - Handling interactive states (hover, focus) with utility classes

2. **JavaScript**:

   - Implementation of an interactive accordion
   - Event handling for keyboard and mouse interaction
   - Class toggling for showing/hiding content

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Implementation of keyboard navigation
   - Usage of ARIA attributes to improve accessibility
   - Semantic HTML structure

### Continued development

Areas I would like to focus on in future projects:

- Improve accordion animation using CSS transitions
- Implement unit testing
- Optimize image loading performance
- Enhance accessibility with more ARIA features

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Excellent resource for learning and consulting utility classes
- [MDN Web Docs - ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - Great resource for learning about web accessibility
- [Google Fonts - Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) - The font used in this project
